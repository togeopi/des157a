            <p>Forms generally are not very fun, if anything they are very annoying and tedious. Reading through the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design Article</a> was very helpful in the sense of UX. Layout and postioning is very important in terms of usability and readability.</p> 

            <p>There are a lot of tips in the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> for best practices when it comes to creating forms. In practice, the small things matter and go a long way when it comes to usability. A few tips that stood out to me was minimizing the input fields in relation to having multiple steps. When you cannot minimize the number of fields, it is safe to make the form into several steps to minimize user's cognitive load.</p>

            <p>One website form that I have used in the past is <a href="https://itch.io/game/new">itch.io's</a> new project page. This form exemplifies best practices because there is an explanation for every input field and each field is labeled. This makes it easier to fill out as there is no room for confusion.</p>
