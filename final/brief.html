        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <div id="article1">
            <p>The project I chose to improve and update is Studio 2: Every Picture project. The reason I chose to work on this project is because I feel very inspired to make this project feel interactive as I felt I had the most creative freedom for this project.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <div id="article2">
            <p>My main focus point of improving this project is functionality. Since I am imitating a music player, I want it to feel as close to this concept as much as possible with my own personal taste. At first, I was imitating the UI of Spotify, but after some thinking I want my project to feel more like a game. I am taking out the concept of playlists and more so focusing on the feelings each picture has and a song that connects to it.</p>

            <p>First, I want to improve the UI of my project as I have changed my overall concept. I need to focus on the layout of each playlist being shown and how to make it feel realistic. I am adding a new feature where I ask the user for a mood which in result returns a specific image and song.</p>

            <p>Because my main focus is functionality, I am focusing less on the content of the project and more on the feel of my project. I will put in the necessary effort to make my project look nice and use music to imitate a real musisc player, but my main focus is the feel and functionality of all of these areas combined together. Because my project requires a prompt, I need to do this in way that it doesn't feel out of place and works correctly.</p>

        <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
        <div id="article3">
            <p>
                Since my main focus is the functionality of my project, I will be seeking advice and feedback from a graduate advisor in the club that I am in. He did a lot of front-end development during his undergrad years and I have had a few conversations with him about front-end stuff. This grad student has seen a lot of my previous work involving games I have made so he has a good sense of my creative direction and can help me bring my ideas to life.
