            <p>I created a flow diagram to illustrate user input. My project starts with prompting the user to enter a mood. In return, there are five options to choose from each giving different results. This concept is different than my original idea as orginally I was simply creating a music player. In this concept I am making my project more interactive by adding a prompt and making the sound bar interactive.</p>

        <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
        <div id="article2">
            <img src="images/pseudocode1.png" width="450" height="400" alt="pseudcode for javaScript code">
            <p>The code that I need to write requires the user to fill out a form and in return a song and photo is displayed based off of the mood the user types in. First I created a variable to grab the user data and a variable for each individual mood overlay. I then created a variable for each value that is returned.</p>
            <img src="images/pseudocode2.png" width="450" height="400" alt="pseudcode for javaScript code">
            <p>I created multiple if statements based on what mood the user chooses. If the user types a certain mood, a specific overlay that is attached to that mood will display the photo, description and play the song for that mood. In order to do this I will have each mood be in the hidden class and change the class name to showing when the user enters the specified mood. </p>
            <img src="images/pseudocode3.png" width="450" height="400" alt="pseudcode for javaScript code">
            <p>The user is then able to close the overlay displayed with a button, this results in the user accessing the entire song library. The user is able to then select each individual mood and explore the song library.</p>
